# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Service Exchange Protocol (SEP) - bringing transparency to service marketplaces.

SEP aims to enable developers to build blockchain secured, consumer anonymous, peer-to-peer service marketplaces for the following structures:
1. Service delivery at a fixed address (e.g. a hotel or barber)
2. Service delivery between two or more known, fixed addresses (e.g. trains or flights)
3. Service delivery between two or more random addresses (e.g. ride-hailing or food delivery)
